# SentinelSecure System Architecture Design

## Implementation Approach

For the SentinelSecure cybersecurity platform, we'll implement a comprehensive solution with the following technology stack and approach:

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive design across devices
- **Backend**: Go (Golang) for high-performance, concurrent API services
- **Agent**: C/C++ lightweight daemon with sandboxing capabilities
- **Databases**: 
  - SQLite for local deployments
  - PostgreSQL for cloud/enterprise deployments
- **Deployment**: Docker containers and native binaries for various platforms (x86, ARM)

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Microservices Architecture** - We'll adopt a modular microservices approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and resilience. This allows different components (scanner, firewall, threat detection) to evolve independently.

2. **Real-time Monitoring with WebSockets** - To achieve the <1s latency requirement for alerts, we'll implement WebSocket connections for real-time notifications between agents and the management server.

3. **Security-First Design** - Implementing TLS 1.3, SHA-256 signatures, RBAC, and 2FA as core aspects of the system's architecture rather than add-ons.

4. **Integration with Open Source Tools** - We'll leverage OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning, NMAP for network scanning, and integrate with existing open-source security tools where appropriate.

5. **Distributed Processing** - The system will distribute scanning workloads across agents to handle the requirement of scanning 500-host subnet within 5 minutes.

6. **Container-based Isolation** - For the agent components, we'll use containerization to provide sandboxing capabilities.

7. **Optimized Resource Usage** - To maintain the <100MB RAM footprint requirement, we'll implement efficient resource management in the agent.

8. **AI/ML Pipeline** - For behavior analysis and threat prediction, we'll implement streaming data processing with lightweight ML models.

## Data Structures and Interfaces

### Core Components

The system will consist of the following core components:

1. **Web Portal** - React-based frontend for user interaction
2. **API Gateway** - Entry point for all client requests
3. **Auth Service** - Handles authentication and authorization
4. **Scanner Service** - Manages vulnerability and network scanning operations
5. **Firewall Service** - Controls firewall rules and configurations
6. **Threat Detection Service** - Analyzes data for potential threats
7. **Update Service** - Manages secure updates and patches
8. **Agent** - Lightweight daemon running on target systems
9. **Database** - Data storage for configurations, scan results, and alerts
10. **Message Broker** - For asynchronous communication between services

## Component Relationships and Detailed Class Design

The system components will interact through well-defined interfaces to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Program Call Flow

The key operational flows within the system include:

1. **User Authentication Flow**
2. **Vulnerability Scanning Flow**
3. **Threat Detection Flow**
4. **Update Deployment Flow**
5. **Alert Management Flow**
6. **Firewall Rule Management Flow**

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Specific threat intelligence data sources**: The PRD mentions threat intelligence integration, but doesn't specify preferred sources or formats. We've designed the system to be flexible with different threat intelligence feeds.

2. **Backup and disaster recovery requirements**: While high availability is mentioned, specific DR policies should be clarified for production deployment.

3. **External API integration details**: While we can integrate with various security tools, specific versions and APIs may need further clarification.

4. **Deployment infrastructure details**: Cloud service preferences, on-premises requirements, and hybrid deployment scenarios could be further elaborated.
